## 0.6.15

### Fix async flush race condition, error handling, and search mode

- Thread sync could permanently lose messages when new turns arrived during an in-flight flush. The message count is now snapshotted before async work begins, so messages pushed by hooks during the network call are correctly saved on the next flush.
- `dispose()` now awaits all pending flushes before tearing down, preventing data loss on plugin disable or reload.
- Recall injection in `willSend` is now wrapped in a try/catch so a server-unreachable or search failure does not break message sending.
- Search mode sent `"normal"` to the backend, which only accepts `"fast"` or `"deep"`. The unrecognized value silently fell through to deep mode (slower, more expensive). Now correctly sends `"fast"` as default. Tool schema updated to match.
- Store tool response fields (`title`, `labels`, `unit_type`, `importance`) were read from the raw API response instead of the unwrapped memory object, causing them to resolve to `undefined` when the API wraps the response in `{ memory: {...} }`.
- Error classification (`cliErrorResult`) used a cascade of `if` statements where later matches could overwrite more specific codes (e.g., "model not found" classified as `model_unavailable` instead of `not_found`). Refactored to an `else if` chain with most-specific patterns first.
- Removed phantom `force` parameter from delete tool schemas (the API does not support forced deletion).
- Removed phantom `input.messages` fallback in thread show tool (not in schema, never sent by LLM).

## 0.6.14

### Async HTTP transport (fixes Alma freeze on Windows)
- All data operations now use direct HTTP `fetch()` to the Nowledge Mem API instead of shelling out to the `nmem` CLI via `spawnSync`. This eliminates the event-loop blocking that caused Alma to freeze for seconds during recall injection and thread sync, especially on Windows where Python process startup is slow.
- The `nmem` CLI is no longer required for normal operation. The plugin connects directly to `http://127.0.0.1:14242` (or the configured remote URL). CLI availability is still checked in the status tool for diagnostic purposes.
- API key is passed via `Authorization: Bearer` header, never as a CLI argument or environment variable.

### Fix memory search, recall injection, and dedup check
- Memory search query parameter was `query` but the HTTP API expects `q`. All memory searches silently returned recent/browse-mode results instead of semantically relevant ones. This broke recall injection (random memories instead of relevant), dedup check in store (compared against wrong memories), and the search/query tools.
- Label filter parameter was `filter_labels` but the API expects `labels`. Label-based filtering was silently ignored.
- Time filter sent enum values (`today`, `week`) to the `event_date_from` field which expects date strings. Corrected to use the `time_range` parameter.

### Fix thread duplication on plugin restart or buffer eviction
- Conversations now use a stable thread ID derived from Alma's internal thread ID (SHA-1 hash). Previously, each plugin restart, LRU eviction, or Alma relaunch caused the same conversation to be saved as a new thread instead of appending to the existing one.
- First flush for a buffer now tries to append to the existing thread before falling back to create. This handles the case where the thread already exists in Nowledge Mem from a prior session.

### Remove dead code and phantom parameters
- Remove unused `saveActiveThread()`, `normalizeThreadMessages()`, `stringifyMessage()`, and `addMemory()` functions (superseded by hook-based live sync and direct HTTP calls).
- Remove `contentLimit` parameter from show/thread_show tools (the HTTP API returns full content; truncation was a CLI-only concept). Remove misleading `truncatedContent` response field.
- Remove unused `force` parameter from deleteMemory/deleteThread client methods (the HTTP API does not support forced deletion).
- Fix `createThread` fallback ID prefix from `cli-` to `alma-`.

## 0.6.13

### Reliable live thread sync (complete rewrite)
- Conversations sync during normal use — no need to quit Alma. Three hooks work together: `willSend` buffers the user message, `didReceive` buffers the AI response and starts a 7-second idle timer, `thread.activated` flushes the previous thread on switch. Quit hooks flush all buffered threads as a safety net.
- All message data comes from hook payloads (`input.content`, `input.response.content`), never from `context.chat.getMessages()` which returns empty in `willSend` timing.
- Thread titles resolved at flush time via `context.chat.getThread()` with 4-strategy fallback — Alma generates titles asynchronously after the first AI response, so early capture misses them.
- Incremental sync: first flush creates a new thread; subsequent flushes append only new messages to the existing thread. (Note: thread identity was session-scoped; cross-session dedup fixed in 0.6.14.)
- Per-thread idle timers: multiple concurrent conversations are tracked independently.
- Content-safe: AI responses in array-of-blocks format (Anthropic API style) are properly extracted.
- Thread buffer LRU eviction at 20 entries with best-effort flush before eviction.
- Concurrent flush guard prevents duplicate saves from overlapping timer/quit/switch triggers.

### Auto-capture on by default
- `autoCapture` now defaults to `true`. New users see thread sync working immediately.

### Broader write guidance
- Behavioral guidance now encourages saving facts and preferences from casual conversations, not just "architecture decisions" and "debugging conclusions."

## 0.6.4

### Behavioral guidance always injected
- Behavioral guidance (use memory tools, save decisions proactively, fetch source threads) is now injected on the first message of every thread, even when there are no existing memories or Working Memory yet. Previously, new users with zero memories got no guidance at all — the AI never learned about Nowledge Mem tools from the plugin alone.

### Recall injection stability
- Remove per-turn `generated_at` timestamp from injected context block — eliminates gratuitous variance in conversation history and improves token efficiency across turns

## 0.6.3

### Live settings reload
- Settings changes (apiUrl, apiKey, recallPolicy, autoCapture, maxRecallResults) now take effect immediately via `settings.onDidChange()`
- No longer requires plugin reload or Alma restart after changing Access Anywhere credentials
- Client is recreated with fresh credentials when apiUrl/apiKey change

### Status diagnostics tool
- Add `nowledge_mem_status` tool for checking connection health and configuration
- Returns: connection mode (local/remote), API URL, API key configured (boolean), CLI availability, server connectivity, and current settings
- Useful for verifying Access Anywhere remote configuration is working correctly

### Plugin lifecycle compliance
- `activate()` now returns `{ dispose }` per Alma `PluginActivation` contract
- Tool and event registrations collect `Disposable` handles for proper cleanup
- Alma can now cleanly unregister all tools and events on plugin deactivation

## 0.6.1

### Access Anywhere (remote access)
- Add `apiUrl` and `apiKey` settings for connecting to a remote Mem instance
- API key is injected via environment variable only (never as CLI arg, never logged)
- URL is passed via `--api-url` CLI flag (safe, not a secret)
- Startup log now shows `mode=remote` or `mode=local`

## 0.6.0

### Thread provenance (sourceThreadId linkage)
- Memory search, show, and query results now include `sourceThreadId` when the memory was distilled from a conversation
- Enables progressive retrieval: find memory -> trace to source conversation -> read full messages

### Structured save with dedup guard
- `nowledge_mem_store` now supports `unit_type` (fact, preference, decision, plan, procedure, learning, context, event)
- Temporal fields: `event_start`, `event_end`, `temporal_context` for when events happened (not when saved)
- Save dedup check: blocks saves at >=90% similarity to existing memories, preventing duplicates
- Dedup is best-effort and never blocks saves on search failure

### Thread pagination
- `nowledge_mem_thread_show` now supports `offset` for progressive retrieval of long conversations
- Returns `totalMessages`, `hasMore`, `returnedMessages` for client-side pagination awareness
- CLI uses `--limit`/`--offset` (requires nmem-cli >=0.6)

### Thread source filter
- `nowledge_mem_thread_search` now accepts `source` parameter to filter by platform (e.g. 'alma', 'claude-code')
- CLI uses `--source` flag (requires nmem-cli >=0.6)

### Behavioral guidance
- Recall injection hook now includes proactive save nudge and sourceThreadId awareness
- Updated CLI playbook with new flags (`--unit-type`, `--source`, `--offset`, `--limit`)

### Improved tool descriptions
- All tool descriptions updated to mention sourceThreadId linkage and progressive retrieval patterns
- Store tool description encourages proactive saving with structured types
