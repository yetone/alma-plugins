# Nowledge Mem Alma Plugin

Local-first personal memory for [Alma](https://alma.now), powered by [Nowledge Mem](https://mem.nowledge.co).

This plugin gives Alma chat-native persistent memory:

- Search your memory graph during chats with tools
- Save structured decisions, insights, and facts with typed knowledge nodes
- Trace memories back to source conversations via sourceThreadId linkage
- Progressive retrieval: paginate through long conversation threads
- Dedup guard: prevents saving near-identical memories (>=90% similarity)
- Inject Context Bundle + relevant recall context before first send, with Working Memory fallback for older servers
- Behavioral guidance: proactive save nudge + thread awareness in every turn
- Native Alma Skill bundle for stronger tool-selection guidance in Alma's Skills surface
- Save thread snapshots back to Nowledge Mem on quit (optional)

Data operations use the Nowledge Mem HTTP API, so local desktop and remote Access Anywhere setups share the same behavior. The status tool may still use `nmem` / `uvx --from nmem-cli nmem` for diagnostics.

## Requirements

- [Nowledge Mem](https://mem.nowledge.co) desktop app or `nmem` CLI
- [Alma](https://alma.now/)

## Install

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nowledge-co/community.git
cd community/nowledge-mem-alma-plugin
npm install
```

2. Install as a local Alma plugin:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem
cp -R . ~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem
```

3. Restart Alma.

## Response Contract

- Search tools (`nowledge_mem_search`, `nowledge_mem_thread_search`) return:
  - `{ ok, type, query, total, items, raw }` — items may include `sourceThreadId`
- Query tool (`nowledge_mem_query`) returns:
  - `{ ok, query, source, sourceReason, total, items, raw }` — memory items include `sourceThreadId`
- Show memory returns:
  - `{ ok, item, truncated, sourceThreadId? }`
- Show thread returns:
  - `{ ok, item, totalMessages, offset, returnedMessages, hasMore, truncatedContent }`
- Store memory returns:
  - `{ ok, item, summary, raw }` (success) or `{ ok, skipped, reason, existingId, similarity }` (dedup)
- Other singleton tools (`update`, `thread_create`) return:
  - `{ ok, item, ... }`
- Delete tools return:
  - `{ ok, id, force, [cascade], notFound, item? }`
- Failure shape is normalized:
  - `{ ok: false, error: { code, operation, message } }`
  - codes: `validation_error`, `nmem_not_found`, `model_unavailable`, `not_found`, `permission_denied`, `invalid_json`, `cli_error`

## Quick Examples

- `nowledge_mem_query` input:
  - `{ "query": "python migration", "limit": 8 }`
- `nowledge_mem_query` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "source": "memory", "sourceReason": "memory_hits", "total": 3, "items": [...] }`

- `nowledge_mem_store` input:
  - `{ "text": "Use pyproject scripts for release", "title": "Release workflow", "unit_type": "decision", "labels": ["devops","python"], "event_start": "2026-02" }`
- `nowledge_mem_store` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "item": { "id": "...", "title": "Release workflow", "unitType": "decision", "labels": ["devops","python"], "eventStart": "2026-02" }, "summary": "Saved: Release workflow [decision] (id: ...)" }`
- `nowledge_mem_store` dedup output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "skipped": true, "reason": "duplicate", "existingId": "mem_abc", "similarity": 0.95 }`

- `nowledge_mem_delete` input (safe default):
  - `{ "id": "mem_xxx" }`
- `nowledge_mem_delete` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "id": "mem_xxx", "force": false, "notFound": false }`

## UX Model

No modal input commands are used. The plugin is designed to stay inside normal chat flow via tool calls and hooks.

## Native Alma Skill

The plugin includes a native Alma Skill at `skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md`. After installing the plugin, open Alma's Skills surface. If the bundled `nowledge-mem` Skill appears there, enable it when you want stronger guidance for when to read Context Bundle, search memory, inspect prior threads, or save durable decisions.

The plugin works without the Skill: tools, auto-recall, and thread sync are registered by the plugin itself. The Skill is supplementary; it improves model intent, especially in chats where Alma exposes Skills prominently.

If the bundled Skill does not appear after installation, copy it into Alma's personal skills folder and refresh Skills:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alma/skills/nowledge-mem
cp ~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem/skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md \
  ~/.config/alma/skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md
```

`alma-skill-nowledge-mem.md` remains as a legacy copy/paste prompt for older Alma builds or manual setups.

## Customize without editing the plugin

Alma does not currently have a separate packaged override file in this integration.

- Use Alma's own settings and the bundled native Skill for extra behavior guidance.
- Keep plugin-level behavior changes in Alma settings such as recall policy, capture policy, remote settings, and space selection.
- Do not patch the installed plugin bundle under `~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem`.

## How It Works

The plugin provides two tiers of memory:

### Tier 1: Thread capture (automatic)

Conversations are synced to Nowledge Mem automatically during normal use. The plugin saves your thread after a few seconds of idle, when you switch threads, or when you quit Alma. You don't need to do anything — conversations are preserved as they happen.

Saved threads appear in the Nowledge Mem desktop app under Threads and can be distilled into structured memories later.

### Tier 2: Memory saves (AI-decided)

During conversation, the AI can use `nowledge_mem_store` to save specific insights, decisions, or facts as structured memories. This happens when the AI judges the information is durable and worth keeping — architecture decisions, debugging conclusions, workflow agreements, preferences.

For casual chat, the AI intentionally does NOT save every message. This is by design: memory should contain signal, not noise. If you want something specific saved, ask: "save this decision to memory."

### Hooks

- **`chat.message.willSend`** — (1) buffers the user message from hook input for live sync, (2) injects recall context (Context Bundle + relevant memories, with Working Memory fallback) per `recallPolicy`.
- **`chat.message.didReceive`** — buffers the AI response from hook input and starts a 7-second idle timer. When the timer fires, the thread is flushed to Nowledge Mem.
- **`thread.activated`** — flushes the previous thread immediately on thread switch.
- **Quit hooks** (`app.willQuit` etc.) — safety net flush before Alma exits.

All thread data comes from hook payloads, never from `context.chat.getMessages()`. Thread titles are resolved at flush time via `context.chat.getThread()` with multi-strategy fallback.

- Auto-recall is preloaded context, not equivalent to a successful plugin tool call in that turn.
- When recalled memories exist, the injected block instructs the model to explicitly disclose when it answered from injected context only.

No plugin commands/slash actions are registered. The plugin runs through tools + hooks only.

## Configuration Policy Matrix

- `recallPolicy=off`: disable recall injection.
- `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once` (default): inject once per thread.
- `recallPolicy=balanced_every_message`: inject before each outgoing message.
- `recallPolicy=strict_tools`: disable recall injection and rely on real `nowledge_mem_*` tools.
- `maxRecallResults`: applies in balanced modes.
- `autoCapture=true` (default): live thread sync via hooks + quit safety net. Set to `false` to disable.

Backward compatibility:

- Legacy keys (`autoRecall`, `autoRecallMode`, `recallFrequency`) are still read at runtime if `recallPolicy` is not set.

Example profiles:

- Conservative, tool-first:
  - `recallPolicy=strict_tools`
  - `autoCapture=true`
- Fast recall for brainstorming:
  - `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once`
  - `maxRecallResults=8`
- CLI-assisted fallback (when chat tool list hides plugin tools):
  - `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once`
  - Let model use Bash + `nmem --help` / `nmem --json ...` patterns from injected playbook

## Access Anywhere (Remote Access)

Connect to a remote Mem instance instead of `localhost`:

- **`nowledgeMem.apiUrl`**: Remote Mem API URL (e.g. `https://mem.example.com`). Leave empty for local.
- **`nowledgeMem.apiKey`**: Mem API key (`nmem_...`). Passed via environment variable only, never as a CLI argument or in logs.

Alternatively, set `NMEM_API_URL` and `NMEM_API_KEY` as environment variables before starting Alma.

Startup log shows `mode=remote` or `mode=local` to confirm which mode is active.

See [Access Mem Anywhere](https://mem.nowledge.co/docs/remote-access) for full setup instructions.

## Spaces

Spaces are optional. Alma should choose one ambient lane only when the profile really belongs to one project or agent lane.

The Alma plugin settings can own that lane directly:

```json
{
  "nowledgeMem.space": "Research Agent",
  "nowledgeMem.spaceTemplate": "agent-${ALMA_AGENT_NAME}"
}
```

Use `nowledgeMem.space` when this Alma profile always belongs to one lane. Leave it empty when you want Alma to inherit `NMEM_SPACE` from the launcher, or stay on `Default` if no ambient lane exists. Use `nowledgeMem.spaceTemplate` only when Alma is launched with a real host-owned environment variable that already identifies the lane. If Alma does not know a real AI Identity, stay on `Default` or run separate Alma profiles for separate lanes.

If you are launching Alma from a shell or launcher with no richer settings surface, you can still set one session-wide fallback lane with:

```bash
NMEM_SPACE="Research Agent"
```

The hook-based Working Memory bootstrap, proactive recall, `nowledge_mem_store`, and automatic thread flushes will then stay in that lane automatically.

Shared spaces, default retrieval, and agent guidance are still owned by Mem's space profile. Alma should pick the lane, not duplicate the profile model.

## Runtime Defaults

The plugin currently uses these defaults:

- Recall policy: `balanced_thread_once`
- Auto-capture on app quit: `true`
- Max recalled memories per injection: `5`
- Automatic thread create/append timeout: 120s (`NMEM_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`, clamped to 1s–30min)

Set `NMEM_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` before launching Alma when a remote Mem instance needs a longer automatic sync window. Manual `nowledge_mem_*` tools keep the existing per-request timeouts.
