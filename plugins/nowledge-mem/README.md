# Nowledge Mem Alma Plugin

Local-first personal memory for [Alma](https://alma.now), powered by [Nowledge Mem](https://mem.nowledge.co).

This plugin gives Alma chat-native persistent memory:

- Search your memory graph during chats with tools
- Save structured decisions, insights, and facts with typed knowledge nodes
- Trace memories back to source conversations via sourceThreadId linkage
- Progressive retrieval: paginate through long conversation threads
- Dedup guard: prevents saving near-identical memories (>=90% similarity)
- Inject Context Bundle + relevant recall context before first send, with Working Memory fallback for older servers
- Behavioral guidance: proactive save nudge + thread awareness in every turn
- Native Alma Skill bundle for stronger tool-selection guidance in Alma's Skills surface
- Save thread snapshots back to Nowledge Mem on quit (optional)

Data operations use the Nowledge Mem HTTP API, so local desktop and remote Access Anywhere setups share the same behavior. The status tool may still use `nmem` / `uvx --from nmem-cli nmem` for diagnostics.

## Requirements

- [Nowledge Mem](https://mem.nowledge.co) desktop app or `nmem` CLI
- [Alma](https://alma.now/)

## Response Contract

- Search tools (`nowledge_mem_search`, `nowledge_mem_thread_search`) return:
  - `{ ok, type, query, total, items, raw }` — items may include `sourceThreadId`
- Query tool (`nowledge_mem_query`) returns:
  - `{ ok, query, source, sourceReason, total, items, raw }` — memory items include `sourceThreadId`
- Show memory returns:
  - `{ ok, item, truncated, sourceThreadId? }`
- Show thread returns:
  - `{ ok, item, totalMessages, offset, returnedMessages, hasMore, truncatedContent }`
- Store memory returns:
  - `{ ok, item, summary, raw }` (success) or `{ ok, skipped, reason, existingId, similarity }` (dedup)
- Other singleton tools (`update`, `thread_create`) return:
  - `{ ok, item, ... }`
- Delete tools return:
  - `{ ok, id, force, [cascade], notFound, item? }`
- Failure shape is normalized:
  - `{ ok: false, error: { code, operation, message } }`
  - codes: `validation_error`, `nmem_not_found`, `model_unavailable`, `not_found`, `permission_denied`, `invalid_json`, `cli_error`

## Quick Examples

- `nowledge_mem_query` input:
  - `{ "query": "python migration", "limit": 8 }`
- `nowledge_mem_query` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "source": "memory", "sourceReason": "memory_hits", "total": 3, "items": [...] }`

- `nowledge_mem_store` input:
  - `{ "text": "Use pyproject scripts for release", "title": "Release workflow", "unit_type": "decision", "labels": ["devops","python"], "event_start": "2026-02" }`
- `nowledge_mem_store` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "item": { "id": "...", "title": "Release workflow", "unitType": "decision", "labels": ["devops","python"], "eventStart": "2026-02" }, "summary": "Saved: Release workflow [decision] (id: ...)" }`
- `nowledge_mem_store` dedup output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "skipped": true, "reason": "duplicate", "existingId": "mem_abc", "similarity": 0.95 }`

- `nowledge_mem_delete` input (safe default):
  - `{ "id": "mem_xxx" }`
- `nowledge_mem_delete` output:
  - `{ "ok": true, "id": "mem_xxx", "force": false, "notFound": false }`

## UX Model

No modal input commands are used. The plugin is designed to stay inside normal chat flow via tool calls and hooks.

## Native Alma Skill

The plugin includes a native Alma Skill at `skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md`. After installing the plugin, open Alma's Skills surface. If the bundled `nowledge-mem` Skill appears there, enable it when you want stronger guidance for when to read Context Bundle, search memory, inspect prior threads, or save durable decisions.

The plugin works without the Skill: tools, auto-recall, and thread sync are registered by the plugin itself. The Skill is supplementary; it improves model intent, especially in chats where Alma exposes Skills prominently.

If the bundled Skill does not appear after installation, copy it into Alma's personal skills folder and refresh Skills:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alma/skills/nowledge-mem
cp ~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem/skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md \
  ~/.config/alma/skills/nowledge-mem/SKILL.md
```

`alma-skill-nowledge-mem.md` remains as a legacy copy/paste prompt for older Alma builds or manual setups.

## Customize without editing the plugin

Alma does not currently have a separate packaged override file in this integration.

- Use Alma's own settings and the bundled native Skill for extra behavior guidance.
- Keep plugin-level behavior changes in Alma settings such as recall policy, capture policy, remote settings, and space selection.
- Do not patch the installed plugin bundle under `~/.config/alma/plugins/nowledge-mem`.

## How It Works

The plugin provides two tiers of memory:

### Tier 1: Thread capture (automatic)

The plugin attempts to sync completed conversation turns to Nowledge Mem after a few seconds of idle, on thread switches, and during quit or plugin disposal. Capture is best-effort, not a guarantee that every message survives shutdown.

Alma documents a shared 3-second budget for `app.willQuit` handlers and a 5-second budget for plugin `dispose()`. This plugin uses one 2.5-second quit deadline or 4.5-second disposal deadline for all automatic sync work, including requests already in flight, response bodies, title lookup, and sequential append/create/reconciliation. Deadline expiry aborts HTTP and prevents further requests or ACK advancement. Concurrent or repeated lifecycle callbacks without intervening activity do not renew the deadline. Normal automatic HTTP requests retain their independent 120-second default; manual create retains 30 seconds. Teardown stops waiting for title APIs and uses the captured user text as a fallback so HTTP can use the remaining budget. Public title APIs themselves cannot be canceled; their late results do not start further sync work.

The active buffer cache holds up to 20 threads. Evicted buffers with unsaved messages remain in a separate in-memory draining set until fully acknowledged. Revisiting a draining thread reuses its buffer and in-flight request. Failed drains and incomplete turns remain available for a later revisit or quit/dispose attempt. Each capture is persisted to `thread-sync-outbox.json` under Alma's public plugin `storagePath`, before HTTP transmission; every save atomically replaces the entire outbox rather than appending a record. The outbox stores only authorized captured text, the necessary acknowledged prefix/checkpoint, and the frozen pending batch/idempotency key. Matching-destination records are restored on activation and scheduled for a single idle attempt when capture is enabled. Fully acknowledged canonical records retain their capture cutoff, stable message IDs, content and checkpoint so rereads after restart cannot duplicate messages; their pending queue is empty. Legacy records without a capture cutoff can be removed after acknowledgement. Failed or incomplete records are retained, not silently aged out. The draining set and pending outbox can still grow during prolonged failure. There is no unlimited background retry loop.

For live buffers, a destination change resets the sync cursor and replays retained history to the new destination. An already-running request may still send its pre-change snapshot to the old destination, but cannot include messages captured after the change. Recovered outbox records are stricter: they remain bound to the hash of their original URL, credentials, and space, including a settings change after restoration. Other lanes remain dormant. No API keys, authorization headers, or raw endpoint URLs are stored in the outbox.

Durability boundaries:

- Outbox replacement uses a private, uniquely named temporary file, file `fsync`, same-directory atomic rename, then directory `fsync` on POSIX. Windows retains file `fsync` and rename but skips the unsupported directory flush; rename metadata is not explicitly flushed there. Synchronous writes preserve ordering within the host event loop. A writer token fences superseded activations in that host; sharing one storage directory between independent host processes is not supported. Invalid records fail activation before hook registration, and a failed pre-send write prevents HTTP.
- The outbox is local plaintext with mode `0600`, not a second encrypted secret store. Disable automatic capture to stop new capture; existing pending records are retained. Successful ACKs clear pending work but retain canonical capture checkpoints and plaintext content for identity deduplication; filesystem snapshots/backups may also retain older bytes.
- Recovery requires the same plugin storage to survive. **Storage retention alone does not establish product recovery after uninstall or reinstall; that recovery is not promised.** The plugin does not copy data outside host-owned storage to evade deletion. A missing `storagePath` produces an explicit warning and falls back to legacy memory-only behavior.
- This is not a hard real-time or power-loss guarantee. Whole-outbox serialization and synchronous filesystem I/O (including `fsync`) block the event loop and cannot be preempted by timers or AbortController, so a large backlog or blocked filesystem can exceed the nominal deadline; another plugin may consume the host's shared quit allowance before this handler runs. Messages lost before their capture write completes, disk failure/fullness, device cache/fsync limitations, storage deletion, and backend durability/contract violations remain boundaries. A lost response retains the frozen attempt for checkpoint/idempotency replay, rather than assuming the server did not write.

Saved threads appear in the Nowledge Mem desktop app under Threads and can be distilled into structured memories later.

### Tier 2: Memory saves (AI-decided)

During conversation, the AI can use `nowledge_mem_store` to save specific insights, decisions, or facts as structured memories. This happens when the AI judges the information is durable and worth keeping — architecture decisions, debugging conclusions, workflow agreements, preferences.

For casual chat, the AI intentionally does NOT save every message. This is by design: memory should contain signal, not noise. If you want something specific saved, ask: "save this decision to memory."

### Hooks

- **`chat.message.willSend`** — (1) rereads canonical stored records for live sync, (2) injects recall context (Context Bundle + relevant memories, with Working Memory fallback) per `recallPolicy`.
- **`chat.message.didReceive`** — rereads canonical stored records and starts a 7-second idle timer. When the timer fires, the thread is flushed to Nowledge Mem.
- **`thread.activated`** — flushes the previous thread immediately on thread switch.
- **Quit hooks** (`app.willQuit` etc.) — safety net flush before Alma exits.

Thread text comes only from `context.chat.getMessages(threadId)` records (`id`, `role`, outer `createdAt`, and `content.parts`). Hook input and transformed output coordinate capture and recall; they are never fallback sources for saved text. Records before activation are excluded; timestamps equal to the activation millisecond are included. Durable cutoffs and IDs survive restart and LRU eviction. Distinct IDs with identical text remain distinct. Missing/malformed records and bounded read failures retain progress for the next activity without logging rejected content. Obsolete destination/lifecycle reads cannot commit. Thread titles are resolved at flush time via `context.chat.getThread()` with multi-strategy fallback.

- Auto-recall is preloaded context, not equivalent to a successful plugin tool call in that turn.
- When recalled memories exist, the injected block instructs the model to explicitly disclose when it answered from injected context only.

No plugin commands/slash actions are registered. The plugin runs through tools + hooks only.

## Local validation

From this plugin directory, `npm run test:sync` covers transport, lifecycle, persistence, recovery-adapter and probe-cleanup changes. `npm test` additionally covers delta and space resolution; `npm run check` checks production syntax. CI runs the same full entrypoint for Alma-only changes on Node 22/24 and Linux/Windows, without live host access or credentials.

Shutdown and cleanup tests use real temporary files, loopback HTTP, child-process diagnostics and a virtual clock. Shutdown uses one clock for the file: resetting clocks between cases can leave transport timer handles tied to a previous queue. A separate real-time assertion verifies that native `AbortSignal.timeout` is not advanced by the virtual `setTimeout`/`Date` clock. Host SDK contexts and the loopback Mem protocol remain explicit synthetic adapters, not a substitute for all real backend contracts. Real rename failures and native file reopen are covered; ENOSPC, partial writes, file/directory fsync failures, power loss and native Windows execution require their own environment evidence.

The opt-in `tests/host-recovery.mjs` exercises the candidate in an actual host using synthetic persisted UIMessage records, dedicated plugin disable/enable and one UUID-owned Mem thread. It verifies canonical HTTP/readback, lost-ACK replay, pending-empty checkpoints and ID deduplication. It does not prove native chat capture or actual application quit. Only run with `PR620_HOST_TEST=1` and a new evidence directory. Cleanup attempts each owned resource independently and retains failures. `tests/first-turn-host.mjs` is a separate, user-driven host-shape observer, not candidate plugin E2E; its content-equality failure must not be interpreted as a capture pass.

## Configuration Policy Matrix

- `recallPolicy=off`: disable recall injection.
- `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once` (default): inject once per thread.
- `recallPolicy=balanced_every_message`: inject before each outgoing message.
- `recallPolicy=strict_tools`: disable recall injection and rely on real `nowledge_mem_*` tools.
- `maxRecallResults`: applies in balanced modes.
- `autoCapture=true` (default): live thread sync via hooks + quit safety net. Set to `false` to disable.

Backward compatibility:

- Legacy keys (`autoRecall`, `autoRecallMode`, `recallFrequency`) are still read at runtime if `recallPolicy` is not set.

Example profiles:

- Conservative, tool-first:
  - `recallPolicy=strict_tools`
  - `autoCapture=true`
- Fast recall for brainstorming:
  - `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once`
  - `maxRecallResults=8`
- CLI-assisted fallback (when chat tool list hides plugin tools):
  - `recallPolicy=balanced_thread_once`
  - Let model use Bash + `nmem --help` / `nmem --json ...` patterns from injected playbook

## Access Anywhere (Remote Access)

Connect to a remote Mem instance instead of `localhost`:

- **`nowledgeMem.apiUrl`**: Remote Mem API URL (e.g. `https://mem.example.com`). Leave empty for local.
- **`nowledgeMem.apiKey`**: Mem API key (`nmem_...`). Passed via environment variable only, never as a CLI argument or in logs.

Alternatively, set `NMEM_API_URL` and `NMEM_API_KEY` as environment variables before starting Alma.

Startup log shows `mode=remote` or `mode=local` to confirm which mode is active.

See [Access Mem Anywhere](https://mem.nowledge.co/docs/remote-access) for full setup instructions.

## Spaces

Spaces are optional. Alma should choose one ambient lane only when the profile really belongs to one project or agent lane.

The Alma plugin settings can own that lane directly:

```json
{
  "nowledgeMem.space": "Research Agent",
  "nowledgeMem.spaceTemplate": "agent-${ALMA_AGENT_NAME}"
}
```

Use `nowledgeMem.space` when this Alma profile always belongs to one lane. Leave it empty when you want Alma to inherit `NMEM_SPACE` from the launcher, or stay on `Default` if no ambient lane exists. Use `nowledgeMem.spaceTemplate` only when Alma is launched with a real host-owned environment variable that already identifies the lane. If Alma does not know a real AI Identity, stay on `Default` or run separate Alma profiles for separate lanes.

If you are launching Alma from a shell or launcher with no richer settings surface, you can still set one session-wide fallback lane with:

```bash
NMEM_SPACE="Research Agent"
```

The hook-based Working Memory bootstrap, proactive recall, `nowledge_mem_store`, and automatic thread flushes will then stay in that lane automatically.

Shared spaces, default retrieval, and agent guidance are still owned by Mem's space profile. Alma should pick the lane, not duplicate the profile model.

## Runtime Defaults

The plugin currently uses these defaults:

- Recall policy: `balanced_thread_once`
- Auto-capture on app quit: `true`
- Max recalled memories per injection: `5`
- Automatic thread create/append timeout: 120s (`NMEM_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`, clamped to 1s–30min)

Set `NMEM_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` before launching Alma when a remote Mem instance needs a longer automatic sync window. Manual thread creation uses a 30-second timeout, independently of the automatic sync setting. Other manual `nowledge_mem_*` tools keep their existing per-request timeouts.
